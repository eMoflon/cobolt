/**
 * In your overlay/app/service please extend the abstract classes
 * {@link PeriodicOperation} and {@link AbstractOperation}!
 * 
 * This class realizes the <i>command pattern</i> for common operations in a
 * distributed system. Typically, if some action should take place in a
 * component of a host, the action will be represented by an operation object
 * providing the required functionality. Examples of operations could be:
 * JoinOperation, SearchOperation, DisconnectOperation etc.
 * <p/>
 * The basic operation provides the knowledge about its state: finished or not
 * and if finished - successful or not. The main functionality of this class is
 * its ability to be <i>scheduled</i> in the simulator.
