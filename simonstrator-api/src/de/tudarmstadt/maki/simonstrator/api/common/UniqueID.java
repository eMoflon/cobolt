 * which might, thus, be overlay-specific. A UniqueID is NEVER overlay-specific!
 * 
 * This concept eases the creation of globally unified workload apps and
 * evaluation setups, where new IDs need to be guessed or created from within
 * the app. Creation of OverlayIDs should always be done via the respective
 * IDSpace.
