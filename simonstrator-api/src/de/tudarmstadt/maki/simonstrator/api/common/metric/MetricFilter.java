/**
 * A metric filter takes one or more Metrics, performs some kind of
 * computation/aggregation on top of them and provides the results as a new,
 * derived metric.
 * 
 * Filters support black- and white-listing of Metrics to define their input
 * channels. They only support N:N and N:1 relationships, but not N:M or 1:M
 * relationships. This is enforced to provide an automatic naming scheme for
 * derived metrics to ease creation of chains. Derived metrics are named after
 * the filter and their input in the following manner:
 * 
 * N:N: input: metric, output: filter_metric, for example "nodes_online" becomes
 * "average_nodes_online".
 * 
 * N:1: inputs: metric1, metric2, output: filter_metric1_metric2.
 * 
 * Filters can become more advanced than this basic scheme by defining
 * additional config parameters, for example metrics that are used as normalizer
 * (number of hosts online, for example). The Filter can retrieve the metric
 * identified by its name via the MetricAnalyzer. Furthermore, those filters may
 * decide to overwrite the default naming scheme to prevent collisions on
 * multiple instances.
