/**
 * Consumer interface, i.e., interface used to access information from the SiS.
 * Complex request patterns are modeled using {@link SiSRequest}s. In general we
 * distinguish between <i>local state</i> and <i>observations</i>.
 * 
 * <i>Local state</i> is associated to our own node (e.g., a buffer length or a
 * battery level) and can be retrieved from one or more of the currently running
 * mechanisms on that node (without using monitoring). If the value cannot be
 * directly retrieved, it may be derived from another state value. As these
 * operations involve only the local node, the result is returned directly.
 * 
 * <i>Observations</i> denote state of other nodes in the network. An
 * observation might, for example, be the RTT to another node, or the average
 * RTT in the current subnet. Usually, some observations are kept locally (e.g.,
 * the RTT to direct neighbors), whereas others might need to be fetched by the
 * monitoring system (e.g., the average RTT in the whole subnet). Therefore, two
 * differnet access method types exist in this interface: local observations can
 * be retrieved without any network activity (e.g., solely based on local
 * available information of other mechanisms), meaning that the result is
 * directly available. Aggregated and raw observations answering a general
 * {@link SiSRequest} might involve monitoring or active collection, therefore
 * requiring a callback for result delivery.
