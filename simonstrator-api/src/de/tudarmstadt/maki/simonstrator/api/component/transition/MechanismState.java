/**
 * Annotation that supports state changes within a mechanism (e.g., setting and
 * altering internal variables). This is internally realized as a
 * {@link SelfTransition}, however, the object implementing
 * {@link SelfTransition} is automatically created if this annotation is used,
 * allowing much simpler code for simple state changes.
 * 
 * An example for such a mechanism-state variable might be a gossip parameter
 * within a local dissemination mechanism. Please note: to avoid
 * inconsistencies, the generated code does NOT alter the field directly.
 * Instead, it searches for a setter-method according to the value of this
 * annotation.
