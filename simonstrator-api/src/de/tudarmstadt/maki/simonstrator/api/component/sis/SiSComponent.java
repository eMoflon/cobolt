 * This component provides the service interface for the SiS (System Information

 * access information from other components or the network, or (ii) provide
 * information to other components or the network.
 * 
 * Bringing providers and consumers together is then an integral part of the

 * the MAKI-Seminar (see Synology for slideset).
