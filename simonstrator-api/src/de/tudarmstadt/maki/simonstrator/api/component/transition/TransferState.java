/**
 * Annotate fields that you want to automatically migrate during a transition.
 * Usually, this makes sense if you have an abstract base class for your
 * strategies and have some field like, e.g., a reference to a local overlay
 * component that is required by all of those.
 * 
 * If a <strong>field</strong> is marked with @TransferState, but the target
 * component does not also carry a field or a constructor with the annotation
 * and the same type and name, the transfer of the respective value is discarded
 * silently.
 * 
 * This annotation might also be used to annotate a <strong>constructor</strong>
 * - in this case, the respective annotation has to carry the names of the
 * variables that are to be transfered in the order they are used by the
 * constructor.
 * 
 * For more complex transformations of state between different transition
 * enabled components, you need to specify a custom instance of an
 * {@link AtomicTransitionStrategy}.
