/**
 * We use URIs to define topics - this enables nesting and categorization
 * through prefix matching. A topic is just a special kind of {@link Attribute},
 * if you do not need the added complexity of a content-based pub/sub. It also
 * provides a shortcut to the built-in prefix matching filter.
 * 
 * A Topic is, thus, an URI in the form
 * 
 * <code>/event/transition/trigger</code>
 * 
 * The basic pub/sub component can thus be seen as topic / channel based, but
 * further semantics on top, using attributes (i.e., numerical ranges) are
 * possible as well, leading to a more content-based pub/sub.
