/**
 * Simple sensor notifying the interested parties of a handover from Mobile to
 * Wi-Fi-AP connectivity, associated to the {@link NetInterfaceName} MOBILE.
 * 
 * This mimics a smartphone's behavior when performing a transparent handover
 * between cellular Internet connectivity and Wi-Fi access point based
 * connectivity.
 * 
 * Note: in peerfact this is implemented within the 5GTopologyView. The
 * underlying {@link NetInterfaceName} does not change (still MOBILE), only the
 * link properties vary.
 * 
 * On Android, this should notify applications and overlays as soon as a
 * handover from Cell to Access point took place.
