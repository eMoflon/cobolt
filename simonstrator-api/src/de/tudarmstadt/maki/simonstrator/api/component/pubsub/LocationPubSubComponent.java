/**
 * An updated approach to location-based pub/sub, adhering to the default
 * subscribe-interfaces and just modifying the createSubscription-call. When
 * creating a subscription, a context resolver is provided that enables the
 * pub/sub system to react to context changes.
 * 
 * Note: notifications are not treated differently - it is assumed that the
 * pub/sub system decides which context to include into notifications to enable
 * correct filtering. In the location-based case, this means that a node's
 * current position may or may not be included in a notification, and that
 * brokers may or may not use a dedicated protocol to resolve context values.
 * Refer to the respective implementation of this interface for further
 * documentation about the contract of the respective overlay.
