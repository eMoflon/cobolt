/**
 * An Energy Model in PeerfactSim.KOM is a Component (as it is configured on a
 * per-host basis with {@link EnergyComponent}s and energy values for these
 * components). The EnergyComponents are registered with the model inside the
 * Factory for the EnergyModel. To access {@link EnergyComponent}s and
 * information about the current battery state, you access this model via the
 * {@link SimHost} object and use the {@link EnergyInfo}-API.
 * 
 * The integration of advanced features such as energy consumption for position
 * determination is implemented in the component that provides the information.
 * In our example, a call to {@link TopologyComponent} getPosition(accuracy)
 * will trigger the corresponding energy consumption if a Positioning-Module is
 * configured as part of this energy model. Long sentence short: in most cases
 * your application should <b>not</b> access {@link EnergyComponent}s directly
 * via this interface but instead rely on the services provided by the
 * corresponding layer.
