/**
 * This interface contains the View for the Social Graph. It has the interface
 * to request the structure of the social graph. Additionally it contains the
 * activity and the interactions of the nodes, which can be used to fill a
 * workload generator. With activity, we mean the activity of the user. This is
 * a value between 0 and 1. The interactions is a edge weight, which represents
 * the interactions between the nodes. The value for the interactions is between
 * 0 and 1.<br>
 * Further, it exists the possibility to derive the community Structure of the
 * social graph. For this, the nodes will be split in clusters.
 * 
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The social connections must <b>not</b> be directional. It is possible
 * that many links are undirected!
 * 
 * <p>
 * ATTENTION: It is possible to create multiple Social graph Views (for example,
 * one for Application and one for Mobility Model). It is not possible to create
 * different {@link SocialView}s for different Host Groups, with the same
 * identifier, because the using Component doesn't know the right component for
 * the host.
