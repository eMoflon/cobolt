 * We want to ease configuration - therefore each MAC provides one

 * to the user (but it should always assume reasonable default values). The idea
 * behind that: a user configures a LinkLayer using only these Configuration
 * Objects, keeping simple configs very short. Please make sure that especially
 * the Config of your MAC-Layer is very well documented!
