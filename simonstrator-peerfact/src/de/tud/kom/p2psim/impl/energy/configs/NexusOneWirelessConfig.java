/**
 * This class contains the measured values from the Nexus One in the AdHoc Mode.
 * It contains the CPU load of a simple application. The basic energy
 * consumption is not included. <br>
 * 
 * For interests:<br>
 * We have measured the energy consumption of the Nexus One in different states
 * (Wifi On, Wifi Send, Wifi Receive, Wifi off). After this, we have the energy
 * consumption of the system in different states. Now we derive the average
 * energy consumption of every state and take the result as power consumption.
 * 
 * TODO: The next step is, we derive on the sampled data the
 * "Mixture Density Estimation" to cluster the power states during the sending
 * of data.
