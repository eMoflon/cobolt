 * This class is an interface for other implementation of Rate Managers. The
 * interface will be informed about fails and receives of MAC messages. So it is
 * possible to implement all available Rate Managers, which use the counting of
 * failing and receiving of Messages. It is <b>not</b> possible to implement
 * Rate Managers, which use a modified MAC-Header.<br>
 * The {@link IWifiRemoteStation} can be used to store state information for
 * every station.
 * <p>
 * If a new Rate Manager is implemented, it should be added to the
 * {@link RateManagerTypes} and in the create method in this class.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * This class is based on NS3 (src/wifi/model/wifi-remote-station-manager.cc) by
